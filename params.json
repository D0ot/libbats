{"name":"Libbats","tagline":"RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation C++ agent base library","body":"libbats is a C++ framework to making building your own RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation team easy. Examples of some of the included features are:\r\n\r\n* Modular and layered approach, so you can choose where you want to start: with just the network communication and parsing modules, with a full-fledged football playing agent, or somewhere in between.\r\n* Super fast S-expression parsing.\r\n* Complete Kalman filter for localization of the agent itself, the ball, and all other players, with the possibility to implement and use your own filter instead.\r\n* Inverse Kinematics-based, omni-directional gait generator.\r\n* XML configuration framework.\r\n* Extensive documentation of the full API, with Doxygen created HTML pages, and an additional usage manual.\r\n* Full example agents: after compilation you already have a complete, functioning, goal scoring agent, that consists of only a few lines of code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
